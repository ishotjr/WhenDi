 *
 * The rpk_base64 module provides an efficient method of encoding and decoding Base64 strings.
 *
 * Usage
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Encoding:
 * @code
 *
 *      const char msg = "Hello world";
 *
 *      uint32_t encLength = RPK_Base64_Get_Encoded_Len(strlen(msg));
 *
 *      uint8_t encBuffer = (uint8_t*)malloc(encLength);
 *
 *      uint32_t ret = RPK_Base64_Encode((uint8_t*)msg, strlen(msg), encBuffer, encLength);
 *
 *      if (encLength != ret)
 *      {
 *          // Something went wrong
 *      }
 * 
 * @endcode
 *
 * Decoding:
 * @code
 *
 *      const char* msg = "SGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=";
 *
 *      uint32_t decLength = RPK_Base64_Get_Decoded_Len((uint8_t*)msg, strlen(msg));
 *
 *      uint8_t decBuffer = (uint8_t*)malloc(decLength);
 *
 *      uint32_t ret = RPK_Base64_Decode((uint8_t*)msg, strlen(msg), decBuffer, decLength);
 *
 *      if (decLength != ret)
 *      {
 *          // Something went wrong
 *      }
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * Memory Considerations
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It is the responsibility of the developer to allocate the necessary memory. See 'Usage' section
 * above for methods on obtaining accurate buffer lengths needed.
