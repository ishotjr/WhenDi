 * @addtogroup backlight   LCD backlight
 * This module provides the API to control the LCD backlight level through callback functions.
 *
 * The basic steps to operate the LCD backlight are as follows:
 * -# Initialize the driver with callback functions (#Backlight_Init_Driver)
 * -# Initialize the hardware (#Backlight_Init_Hw)
 * -# Set the backlight level (#Backlight_SetLevel)
 * -# If the backlight is not needed anymore, de-initialize the driver (#Backlight_Deinit_Driver). The backlight will
 * be switched off. It allows to eventually release shared resources.
 *
 * Example - Sample application code to set LCD backlight level without error management
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * @code
 * \#include "backlight.h"
 *
 * backlight_fct_t backlight_fct;
 * backlight_level_t level;
 *
 * backlight_fct.connect_hw = Backlight_Connect;       // callback function to activate backlight hardware resource
 * backlight_fct.disconnect_hw = Backlight_Disconnect; // callback function to deactivate backlight hardware resource
 * backlight_fct.set_level = Backlight_Set_Level;      // callback function to set backlight level
 *
 * Backlight_Init_Driver(&backlight_fct);
 * Backlight_Init_Hw();
 * printf("Set backlight level to medium\n");
 * Backlight_SetLevel(BLIGHT_LEVEL_MEDIUM);
 * [..]
 * Backlight_GetLevel(&level);
 * printf("The current backlight level is: %d\n", level);
 * [..]
 * // if the backlight is not needed anymore, the driver can be de-initialized
 * printf("Deinitialize backlight (it will be turned off)\n");
 * Backlight_Deinit_Driver();
